.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
DappBox uses a single directory to store configuration, crypto keys
and index caches. The location defaults to \fB$HOME/.config/dappbox\fP
(Unix\-like), \fB$HOME/Library/Application Support/DappBox\fP (Mac),
\fB%AppData%/DappBox\fP (Windows XP) or \fB%LocalAppData%/DappBox\fP
(Windows 7+). It can be changed at runtime using the \fB\-home\fP flag. In this
directory the following files are located:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBconfig.xml\fP
The configuration file, in XML format.
.TP
.B \fBcert.pem\fP, \fBkey.pem\fP
The device\(aqs RSA public and private key. These form the basis for the
device ID. The key must be kept private.
.TP
.B \fBhttps\-cert.pem\fP, \fBhttps\-key.pem\fP
The certificate and key for HTTPS GUI connections. These may be replaced
with a custom certificate for HTTPS as desired.
.TP
.B \fBindex\-\fP\fI*\fP\fB\&.db\fP
A directory holding the database with metadata and hashes of the files
currently on disk and available from peers.
.TP
.B \fBcsrftokens.txt\fP
A list of recently issued CSRF tokens (for protection against browser cross
site request forgery).

One or more \fBfolder\fP elements must be present in the file. Each element
describes one folder. The following attributes may be set on the \fBfolder\fP
element:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B id
The folder ID, must be unique. (mandatory)
.TP
.B label
The label of a folder is a human readable and descriptive local name. May
be different on each device, empty, and/or identical to other folder
labels. (optional)
.TP
.B path
The path to the directory where the folder is stored on this
device; not sent to other devices. (mandatory)
.TP
.B type
Controls how the folder is handled by DappBox. Possible values are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B readwrite
The folder is in default mode. Sending local and accepting remote changes.
.TP
.B readonly
The folder is in "send\-only" mode \-\- it will not be modified by
DappBox on this device.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B rescanIntervalS
The rescan interval, in seconds. Can be set to zero to disable when external
plugins are used to trigger rescans.
.TP
.B ignorePerms
True if the folder should ignore permissions.
.TP
.B autoNormalize
Automatically correct UTF\-8 normalization errors found in file names.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following child elements may exist:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B device
These must have the \fBid\fP attribute and can have an \fBintroducedBy\fP attribute,
identifying the device that introduced us to share this folder with the given device.
If the original introducer unshares this folder with this device, our device will follow
and unshare the folder (subject to skipIntroductionRemovals being false on the introducer device).
All mentioned devices are those that will be sharing the folder in question.
Each mentioned device must have a separate \fBdevice\fP element later in the file.
It is customary that the local device ID is included in all folders.
DappBox will currently add this automatically if it is not present in
the configuration file.
.TP
.B minDiskFree
The minimum required free space that should be available on the disk this folder
resides. The folder will be stopped when the value drops below the threshold. Accepted units are
\fB%\fP, \fBkB\fP, \fBMB\fP, \fBGB\fP and \fBTB\fP\&. Set to zero to disable.
.TP

.B copiers, pullers, hashers
The number of copier, puller and hasher routines to use, or zero for the
system determined optimum. These are low level performance options for
advanced users only; do not change unless requested to or you\(aqve actually
read and understood the code yourself. :)
.TP
.B order
The order in which needed files should be pulled from the cluster.
The possibles values are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B random
Pull files in random order. This optimizes for balancing resources among
the devices in a cluster.
.TP

Pull files ordered by file name alphabetically.
.TP
.B smallestFirst, largestFirst
Pull files ordered by file size; smallest and largest first respectively.
.TP
.B oldestFirst, newestFirst

.TP
.B ignoreDelete
When set to true, this device will pretend not to see instructions to
delete files from other devices.
.TP
.B scanProgressIntervalS
The interval with which scan progress information is sent to the GUI. Zero
means the default value (two seconds).
.TP
.B pullerSleepS, pullerPauseS
Tweaks for rate limiting the puller. Don\(aqt change these unless you know
what you\(aqre doing.
.TP
.B maxConflicts
The maximum number of conflict copies to keep around for any given file.
The default, \-1, means an unlimited number. Setting this to zero disables
conflict copies altogether.
.TP
.B disableSparseFiles
By default, blocks containing all zeroes are not written, causing files
to be sparse on filesystems that support the concept. When set to true,
sparse files will not be created.
.TP
.B disableTempIndexes

transfers that are still in progress. When set to true, such information
is not exchanged for this folder.

committing the changes to the internal database.

.SS Listen Addresses
.sp
The following address types are accepted in sync protocol listen addresses:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B TCP wildcard and port (\fBtcp://0.0.0.0:22000\fP, \fBtcp://:22000\fP)
These are equivalent and will result in DappBox listening on all
interfaces, IPv4 and IPv6, on the specified port.
.TP
.B TCP IPv4 wildcard and port (\fBtcp4://0.0.0.0:22000\fP, \fBtcp4://:22000\fP)
These are equivalent and will result in DappBox listening on all
interfaces via IPv4 only.
.TP
.B TCP IPv4 address and port (\fBtcp4://192.0.2.1:22000\fP)
This results in DappBox listening on the specified address and port, IPv4
only.
.TP
.B TCP IPv6 wildcard and port (\fBtcp6://[::]:22000\fP, \fBtcp6://:22000\fP)
These are equivalent and will result in DappBox listening on all
interfaces via IPv6 only.
.TP
.B TCP IPv6 address and port (\fBtcp6://[2001:db8::42]:22000\fP)
This results in DappBox listening on the specified address and port, IPv6
only.
.TP
.B Static relay address (\fBrelay://192.0.2.42:22067?id=abcd123...\fP)
DappBox will connect to and listen for incoming connections via the
specified relay address.

.B Dynamic relay pool (\fBdynamic+https://192.0.2.42/relays\fP)
DappBox will fetch the specified HTTPS URL, parse it for a JSON payload
describing relays, select a relay from the available ones and listen via
that as if specified as a static relay above.

.SH SYNCING CONFIGURATION FILES
.sp
Syncing configuration files between devices (such that multiple devices are
using the same configuration files) can cause issues. This is easy to do
accidentally if you sync your home folder between devices. A common symptom
of syncing configuration files is two devices ending up with the same Device ID.
.sp
If you want to use DappBox to backup your configuration files, it is recommended
that the files you are backing up are in a folder\-sendonly to prevent other
devices from overwriting the per device configuration. The folder on the remote
device(s) should not be used as configuration for the remote devices.
.sp
If you\(aqd like to sync your home folder in non\-send\-only mode, you may add the
folder that stores the configuration files to the ignore list\&.
If you\(aqd also like to backup your configuration files, add another folder in
send\-only mode for just the configuration folder.
