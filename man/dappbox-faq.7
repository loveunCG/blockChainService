.SH GENERAL
.SS What is DappBox?
.sp
DappBox is an application that lets you synchronize your files across multiple
devices. This means the creation, modification or deletion of files on one
machine will automatically be replicated to your other devices. We believe your
data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored. Therefore
DappBox does not upload your data to the cloud but exchanges your data across
your machines as soon as they are online at the same time.
.SS Is it "dappbox", "DappBox" or "SyncThing"?
.sp
It\(aqs \fBDappBox\fP, although the command and source repository is spelled
\fBdappbox\fP so it may be referred to in that way as well. It\(aqs definitely not
SyncThing, even though the abbreviation \fBst\fP is used in some
circumstances and file names.
.SS How does DappBox differ from BitTorrent/Resilio Sync?
.sp
The two are different and not related. DappBox and BitTorrent/Resilio Sync accomplish
some of the same things, namely syncing files between two or more computers.
.sp
BitTorrent Sync, now called Resilio Sync, is a proprietary peer\-to\-peer file
synchronization tool available for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Windows
Phone, Amazon Kindle Fire and BSD. [1] DappBox is an open source file
synchronization tool.
.sp
DappBox uses an open and documented protocol, and likewise the security
mechanisms in use are well defined and visible in the source code. Resilio
Sync uses an undocumented, closed protocol with unknown security properties.

.UNINDENT
.SS Is synchronization fast?
.sp
DappBox segments files into pieces, called blocks, to transfer data from one
device to another. Therefore, multiple devices can share the synchronization
load, in a similar way to the torrent protocol. The more devices you have online,
the faster an additional device will receive the data
because small blocks will be fetched from all devices in parallel.
.sp
DappBox handles renaming files and updating their metadata in an efficient
manner. This means that renaming a large file will not cause a retransmission of
that file. Additionally, appending data to existing large files should be
handled efficiently as well.
.sp
Temporary files are used to store partial data
downloaded from other devices. They are automatically removed whenever a file
transfer has been completed or after the configured amount of time which is set
in the configuration file (24 hours by default).
.SS Why is the sync so slow?
.sp
When troubleshooting a slow sync, there are a number of things to check.
.sp
First of all, verify that you are not connected via a relay. In the "Remote
Devices" list on the right side of the GUI, double check that you see
"Address: <some address>" and \fInot\fP "Relay: <some address>".
[image]
.sp
If you are connected via a relay, this is because a direct connection could
not be established. Double check and follow the suggestions in
firewall\-setup to enable direct connections.
.sp
Second, if one of the devices is a very low powered machine (a Raspberry Pi,
or a phone, or a NAS, or similar) you are likely constrained by the CPU on
that device. See the next question for reasons DappBox likes a faster CPU.
You can verify this by looking at the CPU utilization in the GUI. If it is
constantly at or close to 100%, you are limited by the CPU speed. In some
cases a lower CPU usage number can also indicate being limited by the CPU \-
for example constant 25% usage on a four core CPU likely means that
DappBox is doing something that is not parallellizable and thus limited to
a single CPU core.
.sp
Third, verify that the network connection is OK. Tools such as iperf or just
an Internet speed test can be used to verify the performance here.
.SS Why does it use so much CPU?
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
When new or changed files are detected, or DappBox starts for the
first time, your files are hashed using SHA\-256.
.IP 2. 3
Data that is sent over the network is (optionally) compressed and
encrypted using AES\-128. When receiving data, it must be decrypted.
.IP 3. 3
There is a certain amount of housekeeping that must be done to track the
current and available versions of each file in the index database.
.IP 4. 3
By default DappBox uses periodic scanning every 60 seconds to detect
file changes. This means checking every file\(aqs modification time and
comparing it to the database. This can cause spikes of CPU usage for large
folders.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Hashing, compression and encryption cost CPU time. Also, using the GUI
causes a certain amount of extra CPU usage to calculate the summary data it
presents. Note however that once things are \fIin sync\fP CPU usage should be
negligible.
.sp
To limit the amount of CPU used when syncing and scanning, set the
environment variable \fBGOMAXPROCS\fP to the maximum number of CPU cores
DappBox should use at any given moment. For example, \fBGOMAXPROCS=2\fP on a
machine with four cores will limit DappBox to no more than half the
system\(aqs CPU power.
.sp
To reduce CPU spikes from scanning activity, use a filesystem notifications
plugin. This is delivered by default via Synctrayzor, DappBox\-GTK and on
Android. For other setups, consider using \fI\%dappbox\-inotify\fP <\fBhttps://github.com/dappbox/dappbox-inotify\fP>\&.
.SS Should I keep my device IDs secret?
.sp
No. The IDs are not sensitive. Given a device ID it\(aqs possible to find the IP
address for that device, if global discovery is enabled on it. Knowing the device
ID doesn\(aqt help you actually establish a connection to that device or get a list
of files, etc.
.sp
For a connection to be established, both devices need to know about the other\(aqs
device ID. It\(aqs not possible (in practice) to forge a device ID. (To forge a
device ID you need to create a TLS certificate with that specific SHA\-256 hash.
If you can do that, you can spoof any TLS certificate. The world is your
oyster!)

.SS What if there is a conflict?
.sp
DappBox does recognize conflicts. When a file has been modified on two devices
simultaneously and the content actually differs, one of the files will be
renamed to \fB<filename>.sync\-conflict\-<date>\-<time>.<ext>\fP\&. The file with the
older modification time will be marked as the conflicting file and thus be
renamed. If the modification times are equal, the file originating from the
device which has the larger value of the first 63 bits for his device ID will be
marked as the conflicting file.
If the conflict is between a modification and a deletion of the file, the
modified file always wins and is resurrected without renaming on the
device where it was deleted.
.sp
Beware that the \fB<filename>.sync\-conflict\-<date>\-<time>.<ext>\fP files are
treated as normal files after they are created, so they are propagated between
devices. We do this because the conflict is detected and resolved on one device,
creating the \fBsync\-conflict\fP file, but it\(aqs just as much of a conflict
everywhere else and we don\(aqt know which of the conflicting files is the "best"
from the user point of view. Moreover, if there\(aqs something that automatically
causes a conflict on change you\(aqll end up with \fBsync\-conflict\-...sync\-conflict
\-...\-sync\-conflict\fP files.
.SS Am I able to use nested DappBox folders?
.sp
Do not nest shared folders. This behaviour is in no way supported,
recommended or coded for in any way, and comes with many pitfalls.
.SS How do I rename/move a synced folder?
.sp
DappBox doesn\(aqt have a direct way to do this, as it\(aqs potentially
dangerous to do so if you\(aqre not careful \- it may result in data loss if
something goes wrong during the move and is synchronized to your other
devices.
.sp
The easy way to rename or move a synced folder on the local system is to
remove the folder in the DappBox UI, move it on disk, then re\-add it using
the new path.
.sp
It\(aqs best to do this when the folder is already in sync between your
devices, as it is otherwise unpredictable which changes will "win" after the
move. Changes made on other devices may be overwritten, or changes made
locally may be overwritten by those on other devices.
.sp
An alternative way is to shut down DappBox, move the folder on disk, edit
the path directly in the configuration file and then start DappBox again.
.SS How do I configure multiple users on a single machine?
.sp
Each user should run their own DappBox instance. Be aware that you might need
to configure listening ports such that they do not overlap (see config).
.SS Does DappBox support syncing between folders on the same system?
.sp
No. DappBox is not designed to sync locally and the overhead involved in
doing so using DappBox\(aqs method would be wasteful. There are better
programs to achieve this such as rsync or Unison.
.SS When I do have two distinct DappBox\-managed folders on two hosts, how does DappBox handle moving files between them?
.sp
DappBox does not specially handle this case, and most files most likely get
re\-downloaded.
.sp
In detail, the behavior depends on the scan order. If you have folder A and B,
and move files from A to B, if A gets scanned first, it will announce removal of
the files to others who will remove the files. As you rescan B, B will
announce addition of new files, and other peers will have nowhere to get
them from apart from re\-downloading them.
.sp
If B gets rescanned first, B will announce additions first, remote
peers will reconstruct the files (not rename, more like copy block by
block) from A, and then as A gets rescanned remove the files from A.
.sp
A workaround would be to copy first from A to B, rescan B, wait for B to
rebuild on remote ends, and then delete from A.
.SS Is DappBox my ideal backup application?
.sp
No. DappBox is not a great backup application because all changes to your
files (modifications, deletions, etc.) will be propagated to all your
devices. You can enable versioning, but we encourage the use of other tools
to keep your data safe from your (or our) mistakes.
.SS Why is there no iOS client?
.sp
There is an alternative implementation of DappBox (using the same network
protocol) called \fBfsync()\fP\&. There are no plans by the current DappBox
team to support iOS in the foreseeable future, as the code required to do so
would be quite different from what DappBox is today.
.SS How can I exclude files with brackets (\fB[]\fP) in the name?
.sp
The patterns in .stignore are glob patterns, where brackets are used to
denote character ranges. That is, the pattern \fBq[abc]x\fP will match the
files \fBqax\fP, \fBqbx\fP and \fBqcx\fP\&.
.sp
To match an actual file \fIcalled\fP \fBq[abc]x\fP the pattern needs to "escape"
the brackets, like so: \fBq\e[abc\e]x\fP\&.
.sp
On Windows, escaping special characters is not supported as the \fB\e\fP
character is used as a path separator. On the other hand, special characters
such as \fB[\fP and \fB?\fP are not allowed in file names on Windows.
.SS Why is the setup more complicated than BitTorrent/Resilio Sync?
.sp
Security over convenience. In DappBox you have to setup both sides to
connect two devices. An attacker can\(aqt do much with a stolen device ID, because
you have to add the device on the other side too. You have better control
where your files are transferred.
.sp
This is an area that we are working to improve in the long term.
.SS How do I access the web GUI from another computer?
.sp
The default listening address is 127.0.0.1:8384, so you can only access the
GUI from the same machine. This is for security reasons. Change the \fBGUI
listen address\fP through the web UI from \fB127.0.0.1:8384\fP to
\fB0.0.0.0:8384\fP or change the config.xml:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<gui enabled="true" tls="false">
  <address>127.0.0.1:8384</address>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
to
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<gui enabled="true" tls="false">
  <address>0.0.0.0:8384</address>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then the GUI is accessible from everywhere. You should set a password and
enable HTTPS with this configuration. You can do this from inside the GUI.
.sp
If both your computers are Unix\-like (Linux, Mac, etc.) you can also leave the
GUI settings at default and use an ssh port forward to access it. For
example,
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ ssh \-L 9090:127.0.0.1:8384 user@othercomputer.example.com
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will log you into othercomputer.example.com, and present the \fIremote\fP
DappBox GUI on \fI\%http://localhost:9090\fP on your \fIlocal\fP computer.
.sp
If you only want to access the remote gui and don\(aqt want the terminal
session, use this example,
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ ssh \-N \-L 9090:127.0.0.1:8384 user@othercomputer.example.com
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If only your remote computer is Unix\-like,
you can still access it with ssh from Windows.
.sp
Under Windows 10 (64 bit) you can use the same ssh command if you install
the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
\fI\%https://msdn.microsoft.com/en\-gb/commandline/wsl/install_guide\fP
.sp
Another Windows way to run ssh is to install gow.
(Gnu On Windows) \fI\%https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow\fP
.sp
The easiest way to install gow is with chocolatey.
\fI\%https://chocolatey.org/\fP
.SS Why do I get "Host check error" in the GUI/API?
.sp
Since version 0.14.6 DappBox does an extra security check when the GUI/API
is bound to localhost \- namely that the browser is talking to localhost.
This protects against most forms of \fI\%DNS rebinding attack\fP <\fBhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding\fP> against the GUI.
.sp
To pass this test, ensure that you are accessing the GUI using an URL that
begins with \fIhttp://localhost\fP, \fIhttp://127.0.0.1\fP or \fIhttp://[::1]\fP\&. HTTPS
is fine too, of course.
.sp
If you are using a proxy in front of DappBox you may need to disable this
check, after ensuring that the proxy provides sufficient authentication to
protect against unauthorized access. Either:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Make sure the proxy sets a \fIHost\fP header containing \fIlocalhost\fP, or
.IP \(bu 2
Set \fIinsecureSkipHostcheck\fP in the advanced settings, or
.IP \(bu 2
Bind the GUI/API to a non\-localhost listen port.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In all cases, username/password authentication and HTTPS should be used.
.SS My DappBox database is corrupt
.sp
This is almost always a result of bad RAM, storage device or other hardware. When the index database is found to be corrupt DappBox cannot operate and will note this in the logs and exit. To overcome this delete the \fI\%database folder\fP <\fBhttps://docs.dappbox.net/users/config.html#description\fP> inside DappBox\(aqs home directory and re\-start DappBox. It will then need to perform a full re\-hashing of all shared folders. You should check your system in case the underlying cause is indeed faulty hardware which may put the system at risk of further data loss.
.SS I don\(aqt like the GUI or the theme. Can it be changed?
.sp
You can change the theme in the settings. DappBox ships with other themes
than the default.
.sp
If you want a custom theme or a completely different GUI, you can add your
own.
By default, DappBox will look for a directory \fBgui\fP inside the DappBox
home folder. To change the directory to look for themes, you need to set the
STGUIASSETS environment variable. To get the concrete directory, run
dappbox with the \fB\-paths\fP parameter. It will print all the relevant paths,
including the "GUI override directory".
.sp
To add e.g. a red theme, you can create the file \fBred/assets/css/theme.css\fP
inside the GUI override directory to override the default CSS styles.
.sp
To create a whole new GUI, you should checkout the files at
\fI\%https://github.com/dappbox/dappbox/tree/master/gui/default\fP
to get an idea how to do that.
.SS Why do I see DappBox twice in task manager?
.sp
One process manages the other, to capture logs and manage restarts. This
makes it easier to handle upgrades from within DappBox itself, and also
ensures that we get a nice log file to help us narrow down the cause for
crashes and other bugs.
.SS Where do DappBox logs go to?
.sp
DappBox logs to stdout by default. On Windows DappBox by default also
creates \fBdappbox.log\fP in DappBox\(aqs home directory (run \fBdappbox
\-paths\fP to see where that is). Command line option \fB\-logfile\fP can be used
to specify a user\-defined logfile.
.SS How do I upgrade DappBox?
.sp
If you use a package manager such as Debian\(aqs apt\-get, you should upgrade
using the package manager. If you use the binary packages linked from
DappBox.net, you can use DappBox built in automatic upgrades.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If automatic upgrades is enabled (which is the default), DappBox will
upgrade itself automatically within 24 hours of a new release.
.IP \(bu 2
The upgrade button appears in the web GUI when a new version has been
released. Pressing it will perform an upgrade.
.IP \(bu 2
To force an upgrade from the command line, run \fBdappbox \-upgrade\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that your system should have CA certificates installed which allow a
secure connection to GitHub (e.g. FreeBSD requires \fBsudo pkg install
ca_root_nss\fP). If \fBcurl\fP or \fBwget\fP works with normal HTTPS sites, then
so should DappBox.
.SS Where do I find the latest release?
.sp
We release new versions through GitHub. The latest release is always found
\fI\%on the release page\fP <\fBhttps://github.com/dappbox/dappbox/releases/latest\fP>\&. Unfortunately
GitHub does not provide a single URL to automatically download the latest
version. We suggest to use the GitHub API at
\fI\%https://api.github.com/repos/dappbox/dappbox/releases/latest\fP and parsing
the JSON response.
.SS How do I run DappBox as a daemon process on Linux?
.sp
If you\(aqre using systemd, runit, or upstart, we already ship examples, check
\fI\%https://github.com/dappbox/dappbox/tree/master/etc\fP for example
configurations.
.sp
If however you\(aqre not using one of these tools, you have a couple of options.
If your system has a tool called \fBstart\-stop\-daemon\fP installed (that\(aqs the name
of the command, not the package), look into the local documentation for that, it
will almost certainly cover 100% of what you want to do.  If you don\(aqt have
\fBstart\-stop\-daemon\fP, there are a bunch of other software packages you could use
to do this.  The most well known is called daemontools, and can be found in the
standard package repositories for  almost every modern Linux distribution.
Other popular tools with similar functionality include S6 and the aforementioned
runit.
